'Holidayreport' Achievo module usage instructions
===============================================

1. What is it?
--------------
With the 'holidayreport' module it is possible to get reports of the hours
users have for leave in a year.
              

2. Assumptions
--------------
1) You should have activated the holidayreport module in Achievo. See the 
   doc/INSTALL file for instructions on how to install and activate the 
   module.
   
2) Users who need to work with the holidayreports should have the 
   proper access rights to the holidayreport menu. Use the profile 
   editor in the Employee menu to accomplish this. See also the INSTALL file.
  
   
3. Instructions
---------------
3.1 Managing corrections.

  It is possible to set a number of corrections per user per year. This can be
  used if a user has overtime left of last year that can be used as leave this
  year. You can also use this to set the balance of last year for the first
  year this module is used. After this year the balance can be calculated 
  using a cronscript (see INSTALL).

3.2 Managing leave types.
  
  Leave types are definitions of the different types of leave that are used. 
  This will be used in defining the age rules. For example in The Netherlands 
  you have something like basic leave (everyone gets basic leave), age leave 
  (depending on the age you get extra leave hours) and senior leave (a special
  arrangement for employees above 55 years).

3.3 Managing age rules.

  Age rules can be used to set an minimum age and maximum age to the value
  that is set. 
  For basic leave you can set age minimum and age maximum both to 0 and it
  will be apply for all employees. The value is set in hours and will be used 
  per month or per year (depending on the interpretation). There are three
  different interpretations:
  1. Year. The year type looks at the age an employee will reach in the
     selected year. If that age is betwee nthe minimum and maximum age that
     is set in the rule then the employee gets the hours that are set for the 
     whole year (depending on the contract). For example: an employee is at 1. 
     January 24 years old and will reach the age of 25 this year. If this
     employee also has a contract for this year fulltime this employee gets
     the hours for the whole year for his age.
  2. Month before maximum. With this type you should remember the value set in 
     the age rule is per month and not per year. This type applies when the
     given maximum age is reached in the selected year. For the months that
     the maximum age is not yet reached this rule will apply.
  3. Month after maximum. With this type you should remember the value set in
     the age rule is per month and not per year. This type applies when the 
     given maximum age is reached in the selected year. For the months that 
     the maximum age is already reached and in the month the maximum age is 
     reached this rule will apply.
  You can also set a start and endyear for these rules. 

3.4 Holidayreport and holidayreport per employee

  These are the reports in which is shown how many leave hours an employee
  gets this year (based on the leave types and age rules) and how much he
  already has used of this hours. In the phase edit screen (project edit 
  and then phase edit) it is possible to see detail of the selected
  activities. In this details screen you can set the field "holiday" to
  indicate that this project - phase - activity combination will be used to 
  calculate the hours that an employee has used for leave.
  The age of an employee depends on his birthdate. You should check that is is
  possible to set the employee birthdate in the employee menu. 

3.5 Changing the config options.

  The calculation of the hours per leave type is based on the contract hours
  of the user in the selected year. The value that is set in the age rules is
  based on the hours per year or month (depending on the type) and these hours
  only apply fully if the contract hours are equal to the hours of a fulltime 
  contract. If an employee only has a contract for 20 hours but a fulltime
  employee works 40 hours this employee only gets 50% of the hours set in the 
  age rules (if the rule applies). To set the hours that a fulltime employee 
  works you can put:

  $config["fulltime"] = 36;
  
  in the configs/holidayreport.inc.php. By default the module uses 40.
  It is also possible to change the calculation of the balance of the leave
  hours. Default it rounds the result in favour of the employee. You can
  change this to unrounded by setting:
  
  $config["round"] = true;
  

4. Known Issues
---------------
The rule system works for many situations, but there are rules that will not
fit. If you encounter a situtation where this module is not compatible with
your company holiday regulations, feel free to file a bugzilla entry 
(http://www.achievo.org/bugzilla) describing your holiday regulations.
