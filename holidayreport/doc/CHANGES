Changes in holidayreport 1.0.2
------------------------------
+ When sick_leave module exists, activities with count_as='count as holiday' count
  as holiday in employee_week_report and in employee holiday report. [Yury]
+ Added support for different holiday_rules per organization 
  Please take into account, that you manually need to set the default organization_id
  for the different rules. [Yury]
+ Added holidayhours column to the weekreport node from within the
  holidayreport module [Dennis].
* Replaced addColumn call by installNode in patch to prevent an error when
  upgrading from holidayreport patchlevel 2 or 1. [Guido]
* The number of holidays were calculated on entire months. Fixed, so when an
  employee works until the 15th of june he gets 5,5 months of holidays,
  not 5. [Harrie]
* Moved $config_holidayreport_round and $config_holidayreport_fulltime to
  configs/holidayreport.inc.php (please update this file when upgrading
  this module on your Achievo installation). [Guido]
* Fixed month/monthafter calculation types for holiday rules to take the
  amount of hours (compared to a fulltime week) and the contract start/end
  dates into account.
* Fixed missing leave from leave rules in the holidayreport overview (totaaloverzicht)
  for all employees. Now the overview shows the same values as the per-employee view.
  [Guido]
* Fixed calculation error in month/monthafter calculation types. [Guido]
