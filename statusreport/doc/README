'Statusreport' Achievo module usage instructions
=============================================

1. What is it?
--------------
A status report is a periodical (e.g. weekly) review of the project status by
the project manager. Some data is provided by the project manager when writing
the review, other data is taken from Achievo.

This module doesn't have separate menu item, but add tab with status report to 
project edit screen and add new item(s) to PIM screen.

2. Access rights.
-----------------
This module declare two specific rights - 'pm' (ProjectManager) and 'mt' (Management), 
only users that have one(or both) of these rights have access to the information of the 
status reports.

For users with 'mt' rights this module add one specific option to user preferences -
'show all flagged projects' - managers might want to always see ‘all flagged projects’
by default.

3. PIM items.
--------------
This module add two new PIM items - 'Your currently active projects' for project managers
(users with 'pm' rights), and 'Projects you have MT ownership of' - for management (users
with 'mt' rights). 

'Your currently active projects' - projects where status is ‘active’ and hours have been
booked in the last 14 days, and coordinator is set to the currently logged in user.

'Projects you have MT ownership of' - all projects where status is ‘active’ that
have ‘MT ownership’ set to the logged in manager.
