========================================

---------------
Depite our efforts to keep this INSTALL file as accurate as possible, there
might be situations in which the described procedure does not work.
In this case send an email to ivo@achievo.org or to the mailinglist
(achievo@achievo.org) and we will try to help you out.

Requirements
------------

A working Achievo installation, version 1.0.RC2 or higher.
The module has been tested with 1.0.RC2 and 1.0.RC3.

Installation Procedure
----------------------

1) Place the files from the module in your Achievo external modules directory. 
   Preferably, this is a directory just outside the Achievo root. For example, 
   if your Achievo installation is located in /var/www/html/achievo, put
   this module in /var/www/html/achievo_modules/statusreport.
   
2) Open up Achievo's config.inc.php file and locate the modules setting near
   the bottom of the file. Add the following line to add the StatusReprot module
   to Achievo:
   
   module("statusreport", "../achievo_modules/statusreport/");
   
   The first parameter is the name of the module, and should always be 
   'statusreport'. The second parameter points to the directory where the module
   is located, relative to the directory of Achievo itself.
   
3) Copy statusreport module configuration file named statusreport.inc.php from 
   module directory skel/configs to configs directory of your Achievo installation.
   See comments in above mentioned configuration file about possible configurations. 
   
4) Log out of Achievo, and point your browser to the setup.php script in the
   Achievo directory, for example:
   
   http://yourserver/achievo/setup.php
   
   (As an alternative to step 3 and 4, you can use the Moduleinfo module to 
   install the database.)
   
5) Log in as the 'administrator' user, and follow the directions. If steps 1, 2 
   and 3 went ok, the setup script will indicate that it will have to install
   the statusreport module in the database. 
   
   If the installation went well, you should have a new tab named 'Status report' on the
   project edit screen. (You must grant access to users to the new features,
   using the profile editor in the Employee menu, see more in README file.)

6) See the README file for usage instructions.
