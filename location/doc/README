'Location' Achievo module usage instructions
============================================

1. What is it?
--------------
The 'location' module is a module to keep locations managable.  By itself 
it's somewhat useless, however it's intention is to make life easier for 
various people.

Since details like addresses are often used more than once this allows users 
to update records more efficiently, for example if a company moves 
you should only need to update the address once for all the staff that move too.

If you're a module writer this can be linked in with your new modules to 
make life easier.
              

2. Assumptions
--------------
1) You should have activated the location module in Achievo. See the 
   doc/INSTALL file for instructions on how to install and activate the 
   module.
   
2) Users who need to work with locations should have the proper access rights
   to locations. Use the profile editor in the Employee menu to accomplish
   this.  
  
   
3. Instructions
---------------
Managing locations.

  The location management screens should hopefully be quite self explanatory.
