and we will try to help you out.

Requirements
------------

A working Achievo installation, version 1.3.0 or higher.
The module has been tested with 1.3.2.

Installation Procedure
----------------------

1) Place the files from the module in your Achievo external modules directory.
   Preferably, this is a directory just outside the Achievo root. For example,
   if your Achievo installation is located in /var/www/html/achievo-1.0, put
   this module in /var/www/html/achievo_modules/yubikey.

2) Open up Achievo's config.inc.php file and locate the modules setting near
   the bottom of the file. Add the following line to add the Yubikey module
   to Achievo:

   module("yubikey", "../achievo_modules/yubikey/");

   The first parameter is the name of the module, and should always be
   'yubikey'. The second parameter points to the directory where the module
   is located, relative to the directory of Achievo itself.

   Search for the $config_authentication param and set it to:

   'module.yubikey.security.auth_yubikey'

   And at last copy the /skel/configs/yubikey to your achievo root/configs
   directory and change the settings.

3) If the installation went well, you should a new field when you edit an
   employee called 'yubikey'.

4) See the README file for usage instructions.
