Installing the 'Software' Achievo module
========================================

Read this first
---------------
Depite our efforts to keep this INSTALL file as accurate as possible, there
might be situations in which the described procedure does not work.
In this case send an email to ivo@achievo.org or to the mailinglist
(achievo@achievo.org) and we will try to help you out.

Requirements
------------

A working Achievo installation, version 1.0.RC2 or higher.
The module has been tested with 1.0.RC2 and 1.0.RC3.

Installation Procedure
----------------------

1) Place the files from the module in your Achievo external modules directory. 
   Preferably, this is a directory just outside the Achievo root. For example, 
   if your Achievo installation is located in /var/www/html/achievo-1.0, put
   this module in /var/www/html/achievo_modules/software.
   
2) Open up Achievo's config.inc.php file and locate the modules setting near
   the bottom of the file. Add the following line to add the Software module
   to Achievo:
   
   module("software", "../achievo_modules/software/");
   
   The first parameter is the name of the module, and should always be 
   'software'. The second parameter points to the directory where the module
   is located, relative to the directory of Achievo itself.
   
3) Log out of Achievo, and point your browser to the setup.php script in the
   Achievo directory, for example:
   
   http://yourserver/achievo-1.0/setup.php
   
4) Log in as the 'administrator' user, and follow the directions. If steps 1 
   and 2 went ok, the setup script will indicate that it will have to install
   the software module in the database. 
   
   If the installation went well, you should have a new menu item in Achievo
   called 'Assets'. (You must grant access to users to the new features,
   using the profile editor in the Employee menu.)

5) See the README file for usage instructions.
