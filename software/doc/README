'Software' Achievo module usage instructions
============================================

1. What is it?
--------------
The 'software' module is a module for tracking software licenses. If you are 
a reseller of software, or if you are a company managing software licenses 
for your customers, this module can help you administrate those licenses.


2. Assumptions
--------------
1) You should have activated the software module in Achievo. See the 
   doc/INSTALL file for instructions on how to install and activate the 
   module.
   
2) The user you are going to use to setup the software module should have 
   access to the relevant menuitems. Use the profile editor in the Employee
   menu to accomplish this.
   
3) Users in Achievo should have a contract. The contract (which can be added/
   edited when editing the employee record) defines on which days the user
   works and for how many hours a week. This information is used to determine
   the planning.
