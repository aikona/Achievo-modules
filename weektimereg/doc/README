'Weektimereg' Achievo module usage instructions
===============================================

1. What is it?
--------------
With the 'weektimereg' module it is possible to register time for a complete
week at once in stead of per day.
              

2. Assumptions
--------------
1) You should have activated the weektimereg module in Achievo. See the 
   doc/INSTALL file for instructions on how to install and activate the 
   module.
   
2) Users who need to work with the weekly timeregistration should have the 
   proper access rights to the week timeregistration. Use the profile 
   editor in the Employee menu to accomplish this. See alos the INSTALL file.
  
   
3. Instructions
---------------
3.1 Managing weekly timeregistration.

  The weektimreg management screen is quite self explanatory. Keep in mind
  that time can only be registered per 15 minutes. Hours and minutes need
  to be separated using a ":". 
  Warning: when using both the day registration and the weekregistration the
  weekregistration screen can remove the remarks of the day timeregistration
  records and can also delete complete records of the day timeregistration.
  (It merges them into a single record per activity per project per day.)
  Questions may be posted on the Achievo mailinglist, to which you
  can subscribe by sending an empty message to achievo-subscribe@achievo.org.

3.2 Changing the number of projects listed.

  All projects you already registered time on in a certain are shown in the
  week screen. If there are less than 15 projects in the list, Achievo tries
  to complete the list to 15 with projects you used recently before the 
  selected week. You can change the number of entries that it tries to display by
  adding $config_weektimereg_recentprojects = 25; to the config.inc.php file
  of Achievo (where 25 is the number of projects you want to see). 
  
4. Known Issues
---------------
4.1 Focus problem in Mozilla
  
  In mozilla 1.5 and lower the javascript that is used by this module to 
  validate if the user enters only a valid number of minutes does not work 
  as expected in Mozilla (tested with Mozilla 1.5).
  Javascript is used to validate the input of the minutes when losing focus
  of the textbox. Normally if the input is not correct the focus is placed 
  on the textbox again so the user cannot leave the textbox until the input
  is correct. In Mozilla however, the message is displayed to the user, but
  the focus leaves the field anyway.
  (This is a known issue in mozilla, see their bugzilla entry for more info:
  http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53579)
