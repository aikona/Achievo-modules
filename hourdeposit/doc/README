'Hourdeposit' Achievo module usage instructions
===============================================

1. What is it?
--------------
The 'Hourdeposit' module is a module that lets you keep track of deposits
of hours for customers. A customer may have bought a number of hours from you
in bulk, and one or more projects are done which all should use up hours from
the deposit. 

The module displays the initial amount of hours, the number of hours used and
the number of hours left. Furthermore, it will visually indicate the status
of the deposit. (Orange for 'nearly depleted' and red for 'depleted')

Finally, it displays a graph which indicates the depletion rate of the deposit.
              

2. Assumptions
--------------
1) You should have activated the Hourdeposit module in Achievo. See the 
   doc/INSTALL file for instructions on how to install and activate the 
   module.
   
2) Users who need to work with quotations should have the proper access rights
   to quotations. Use the profile editor in the Employee menu to accomplish
   this.  
  
   
3. Instructions
---------------
3.1 Managing deposits.

  The deposit management screens are quite self explanatory. Questions may be 
  posted on the Achievo mailinglist, to which you can subscribe by sending an 
  empty message to achievo-subscribe@achievo.org.
      
3.2 Influencing the nearly-depleted display.

  By default, the deposit is displayed in orange when there are less than 10 
  hours left in the deposit. You can change this treshold by adding the 
  following to Achievo's config.inc.php file:
  
  $config_hourdeposit_depletionwarning = 8;
  
  Where 8 would be the number of hours which triggers the depletion warning.
