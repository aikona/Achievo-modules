Installing the 'competency' Achievo module
========================================

Read this first
---------------


Requirements
------------
The latest svn version of atk that supports Prototype 1.6.0.2 and  Scriptaculous 1.8.1


Installation Procedure
----------------------

1) Place the files from the module in your Achievo external modules directory.
   Preferably, this is a directory just outside the Achievo root. For example,
   if your Achievo installation is located in /var/www/html/achievo-1.0, put
   this module in /var/www/html/achievo_modules/competency.

   If the server makes dynamic domains its important to put the module in the achievo map itself
    /var/www/html/achievo/achievo_modules/competency for example because the scripts need access
   to sertain java and php scrips in this module that it will be unable to find if the achievo_modules
   are in a diffent domain.

2) Open up Achievo's config.inc.php file and locate the modules setting near
   the bottom of the file. Add the following line to add the competency module
   to Achievo:

   module("competency", "../achievo_modules/competency/");

   The first parameter is the name of the module, and should always be
   'autoduty'. The second parameter points to the directory where the module
   is located, relative to the directory of Achievo itself.

3) Log out of Achievo, and point your browser to the setup.php script in the
   Achievo directory, for example:

   http://yourserver/achievo-1.0/setup.php

4) Log in as the 'administrator' user, and follow the directions. If steps 1
   and 2 went ok, the setup script will indicate that it will have to install
   the competency module in the database.

   If the installation went well, you should have 1 new menu item in Achievo
   called 'competencye management','. (You must grant access to users to the new features,
   using the profile editor in the Employee menu.)

5) The core feature of the module is adding and managing of competences

6) See the README file for usage instructions.
