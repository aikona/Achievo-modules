Depite our efforts to keep this INSTALL file as accurate as possible, there
might be situations in which the described procedure does not work.
In this case send an email to sandy@achievo.org or use the forum
(http://www.achievo.org/forum/) and we will try to help you out.

Requirements
------------

A working Achievo installation, version 1.1.0.
The module has been tested with 1.1.0 stable.

Installation Procedure
----------------------

1) Place the files from the module in your Achievo external modules directory. 
   Preferably, this is a directory just outside the Achievo root. For example, 
   if your Achievo installation is located in /var/www/html/achievo-1.0, put
   this module in /var/www/html/achievo_modules/crm.
   
2) Open up Achievo's config.inc.php file and locate the modules setting near
   the bottom of the file. Add the following line to add the CRM module
   to Achievo:
   
   module("crm", "../achievo_modules/crm/");
   
   The first parameter is the name of the module, and should always be 
   'pinboard'. The second parameter points to the directory where the module
   is located, relative to the directory of Achievo itself.
    
3) If the installation went well, you should have a new menu item in Achievo
   called 'CRM'. (You must grant access to users to the new menuitem,
   using the profile editor in the Employee menu. Note that this is a feature
   that is only intended for the administrators of the Achievo installation.)

4) Optional you can install the initial.sql file in the db directory for some
   default status settings. 

5) See the README file for usage instructions.
