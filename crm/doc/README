'CRM' Achievo module usage instructions
==============================================

1. What is it?
--------------
The 'CRM' module is a module that can be used for all kinds of CRM 
functions. At this moment it will only work with the Achievo stable, the next
(and final) version will only work with new upcoming Achievo based on ATK 5.x.

2. Assumptions
--------------
1) You should have activated the CRM module in Achievo. See the 
   doc/INSTALL file for instructions on how to install and activate the 
   module.
   
   
3. Instructions
---------------
After installation of the module, a new menuitem 'CRM' is added
to main menu of Achievo. Since this is a first version of the CRM
module and it has a long way to go, it has it own company and contacts. 
So it can be tested without screwing up your real contacts. Once this module
finished the contacts and company classes will be merged with the current ones.

So what can you do with this first alpha version, well quite a lot.
At this moment there are 6 major menu's:

- Lead
  Add all your leads here, in the future it will be possible to 
  convert the leads to contacts/company.
- Opportunity
  Add your opportunities here.
- Contact
  Just like the contacts in Achievo, but with some extra fields.
- Company
  Just like the company in Achievo, but with some extra fields.
- Campaign
  Add your company campaigns here.
- Activity
  Add all you activities likes phone calls, emails etc. to contacts/company.

All other menu's are for setting most of the dropdowns use in the above menu items.
In the db directory there is an initial.sql with some default settings for the 
dropdowns to see where they are ment for.

The most screens are quite self explanatory, if you still have questions, patches, 
idea's you can post them on the Achievo Forum (http://www.achievo.org/forum/)
