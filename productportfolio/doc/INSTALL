Despite our efforts to keep this INSTALL file as accurate as possible, there
might be situations in which the described procedure does not work.
In this case send an email to ivo@achievo.org or to the mailinglist
(achievo@achievo.org) and we will try to help you out.

Requirements
------------

- A working Achievo installation, version 1.3 or higher.
  The module has been tested with 1.3 Development.

Installation Procedure
----------------------

1) Place the files from the module in your Achievo external modules directory.
   Preferably, this is a directory just outside the Achievo root. For example,
   if your Achievo installation is located in /var/www/html/achievo-1.0, put
   this module in /var/www/html/achievo_modules/productportfolio.

2) Open up Achievo's config.inc.php file and locate the modules setting near
   the bottom of the file. Add the following line to add the ProductPortfolio module
   to Achievo:

   module("productportfolio", "../achievo_modules/productportfolio/");

   The first parameter is the name of the module, and should always be
   'productportfolio'. The second parameter points to the directory where the module
   is located, relative to the directory of Achievo itself.

3) Grant access to users to the new features, using the profile editor in the
   Employee menu. This module adds the access right "week registration" to the
   timereg module in the profile editor.

4) Database installation of this module or upgrade is not necessary.
   See the README file for usage instructions.
