========================================

---------------
Depite our efforts to keep this INSTALL file as accurate as possible, there
might be situations in which the described procedure does not work.
In this case send an email to ivo@achievo.org or to the mailinglist
(achievo@achievo.org) and we will try to help you out.

Requirements
------------

A working Achievo installation, version 1.0.RC2 or higher.
The module has been tested with 1.0.RC2 and 1.0.RC3.

Installation Procedure
----------------------

1) Place the files from the module in your Achievo external modules directory. 
   Preferably, this is a directory just outside the Achievo root. For example, 
   if your Achievo installation is located in /var/www/html/achievo-1.0, put
   this module in /var/www/html/achievo_modules/qdocument.
   
2) Open up Achievo's config.inc.php file and locate the modules setting near
   the bottom of the file. Add the following line to add the QDocument module
   to Achievo:
   
   module("qdocument", "../achievo_modules/qdocument/");
   
   The first parameter is the name of the module, and should always be 
   'qdocument'. The second parameter points to the directory where the module
   is located, relative to the directory of Achievo itself.
   
3) The module must be told where to store the uploaded document files.
   This is done by adding a config parameter to Achievo's config.inc.php file:
   
   $config_qdocumentpath = "./uploaded_docs/";
   
   The directory should be readable and writable by the webserver, and be
   relative to the Achievo directory.
   
4) Log out of Achievo, and point your browser to the setup.php script in the
   Achievo directory, for example:
   
   http://yourserver/achievo-1.0/setup.php
   
4) Log in as the 'administrator' user, and follow the directions. If steps 1 
   and 2 went ok, the setup script will indicate that it will have to install
   the qdocument module in the database.    

5) See the README file for usage instructions.
