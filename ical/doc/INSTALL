========================================

---------------
Depite our efforts to keep this INSTALL file as accurate as possible, there
might be situations in which the described procedure does not work.
In this case send an email to the mailinglist (achievo@achievo.org) or 
ask your question at our forum http://www.achievo.org/forum/ and we will try 
to help you out.

Requirements
------------
A working Achievo installation, version 1.0.RC2 or higher.
The module has been tested with 1.1RC3 and 1.1.0.

Installation Procedure
----------------------

1) Place the files from the module in your Achievo external modules directory. 
   Preferably, this is a directory just outside the Achievo root. For example, 
   if your Achievo installation is located in /var/www/html/achievo-1.0, put
   this module in /var/www/html/achievo_modules/ical/
   
2) Open up Achievo's config.inc.php file and locate the modules setting near
   the bottom of the file. Add the following line to add the RSS News module
   to Achievo:
   
   module("ical", "../achievo_modules/ical/");
   
   The first parameter is the name of the module, and should always be 
   'ical'. The second parameter points to the directory where the module
   is located, relative to the directory of Achievo itself.

3) Log out of Achievo, and point your browser to the setup.php script in the
   Achievo directory, for example:

   http://yourserver/achievo-1.0/setup.php

   (As an alternative to step 3 and 4, you can use the Moduleinfo module to
   install the database.)

4) Log in as the 'administrator' user, and follow the directions. If steps 1
   and 2 went ok, the setup script will indicate that it will have to install
   the ical module in the database.

   If the installation went well, you should have a new tab in the user
   preferences (link near the top of the screen) if you have the allowed
   acces rights, you must grant access to users to the new item, 
   using the profile editor in the Employee menu. 
   Note that this is a feature that is only intended for the administrators 
   of the Achievo installation.

5) Then you must set the atk_root, which must be the achievo homedir, in the 
   file ical.php so it will find achievo and you can set the number of months
   that will be exported
   
6) See the README file for usage instructions.
