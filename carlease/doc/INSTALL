Installation Procedure
----------------------

1) Place the files from the module in your Achievo external modules directory. 
   Preferably, this is a directory just outside the Achievo root. For example, 
   if your Achievo installation is located in /var/www/html/achievo-1.0, put
   this module in /var/www/html/achievo_modules/carlease.
   
2) Open up Achievo's config.inc.php file and locate the modules setting near
   the bottom of the file. Add the following line to add the Carlease module
   to Achievo:
   
   module("carlease", "../achievo_modules/carlease/");
   
   The first parameter is the name of the module, and should always be 
   'carlease'. The second parameter points to the directory where the module
   is located, relative to the directory of Achievo itself.
   
3) Log out of Achievo, and point your browser to the setup.php script in the
   Achievo directory, for example:
   
   http://yourserver/achievo-1.0/setup.php
   
4) Log in as the 'administrator' user, and follow the directions. If steps 1 
   and 2 went ok, the setup script will indicate that it will have to install
   the autoduty module in the database. 
   
   If the installation went well, you should have a new menu item in Achievo
   called 'Duty planner'. (You must grant access to users to the new features,
   using the profile editor in the Employee menu.)

5) The core feature of the module is an overview of leasecars and it's drivers.
   It will also check when a contract is expiring, 4 moths before a mail will
    be send to the person in the config file
   
   The cron script can be run using Achievo's runcron script. To run the
   planner every day at 9:00h, add the following line to your crontab file:
   
   0 9 * * *  /usr/bin/php /var/www/achievo/runcron carlease.carleasecontracts 
                                                                 > /dev/null
                                                                 
   /usr/bin/php should be the directory where your php command line binary is
   located, and you should replace /var/www/achievo with the directory where
   Achievo is installed.

6) See the README file for usage instructions.
