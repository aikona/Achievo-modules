'Moduleinfo' Achievo module usage instructions
==============================================

1. What is it?
--------------
The 'moduleinfo' module is a module that makes administration of Achievo
extension modules much more easy. It displays installed modules, installation
status, and allows you to deinstall, install and patch modules.


2. Assumptions
--------------
1) You should have activated the moduleinfo module in Achievo. See the 
   doc/INSTALL file for instructions on how to install and activate the 
   module.
   
   
3. Instructions
---------------
After installation of the module, a new menuitem 'Extension modules' is added
to the 'setup' menu of Achievo. Initially, the 'Extension modules' menuitem is
only accessible by the Administrator user, but using the Administrator user,
you can grant access to the module to other users using the profile editor in
the employee menu.

It is advisable to grant access to this module only to the maintainers of the
Achievo installation, since the module allows the user to de-install modules, 
destroying any data present in the system.

When opening the menuitem, you will see a list of installed modules. For each
module, one or more of the following actions may be available:

'install'       -> Install a module. This will create the tables it needs etc.
'uninstall'     -> Remove a module. This will destroy any tables and data
                   associated with the module. 
'patch'         -> If the module sources are newer than the modules' tables, a
                   'patch' action is provided to upgrade the database.
'documentation' -> View the doc/README file of the module (if available).

IMPORTANT: Modules should be activated/deactivated using the config.inc.php
file of Achievo. The 'moduleinfo' module can not and will not modify this file
for you. Therefor, before installing any module into the database, first
activate it in the config.inc.php file.
