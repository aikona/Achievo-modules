Achievo 'Billing' module installation instructions
==================================================

This installation guide assumes that you already have a working
installation of achievo.

Read this first
---------------
Depite our efforts to keep this INSTALL file as accurate as possible, there
might be situations in which the described procedure does not work.
In this case send an email to ivo@achievo.org or to the mailinglist
(achievo@achievo.org) and we will try to help you out.

Requirements
------------

* A working Achievo installation, version 1.2.1 or higher.
* OpenDocument generator support (requires access to the Info-ZIP zip and
  unzip binaries)

Installation steps
------------------

1. Unpack the tgz distribution.

   change to the directory where you want to install the module, e.g.:
   $ cd /home/achievo/achievo_modules

   unpack the tgz file:
   $ tar xvzf billing.tgz

   This will create a directory 'billing' which contains everything
   needed to use the billing module.

2) Open up Achievo's config.inc.php file and locate the modules setting
   near the bottom of the file. Add the following line to add the Billing
   module to Achievo:

   module("billing", "../achievo_modules/billing/");

   The first parameter is the name of the module, and should always be
   'billing'. The second parameter points to the directory where the module
   is located, relative to the directory of Achievo itself.

3. Add tax symbol/included setting and currency symbol to 'config.inc.php'.

   Put the following additional config variables into 'config.inc.php'
   (example for Switzerland):

   $config_tax_symbol = "MWSt.";     // Name of the tax
   $config_tax_included = true;      // Tax included in prices or not?
   $config_currency_symbol = "Fr.";  // Currency used as the default

4. Run Achievo setup to create the nescessary database structures.

   Point your browser to the setup.php script in the Achievo directory. For
   example:

   http://yourserver/achievo/setup.php

   You'll be prompted to login. Enter 'administrator' as username and the
   password you've set in your config.inc.php file. Now the Achievo setup
   wizard will be shown. Follow the on-screen instructions.

5. Granting rights

   If everything went ok, you should get a "Installation complete" message.
   Click "Start using Achievo", go to the Employees menu. You should now
   be able to create or adjust Security profiles in order to give employees
   access to the features of the billing module.

6. Ready to go

   After completing the steps above, you should be ready to use the billing
   features. Open the included README or manual.pdf file to learn about how
   to use the Billing module.

Additional notes
----------------

Previous versions of the billing module used to support pdf generation.
Currently this is disabled in favour of OpenDocument format bills.
