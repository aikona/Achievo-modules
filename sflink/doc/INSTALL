How to Install

1. I don't found, how we can add custom field to the exists account and contact object. So we have to do it by hand:

SETUP->App Setup->Customize->Contacts->Fields->Contact custom fields & relationships->New
->Number->Next->Field label=>'ib_id'->External ID (check on)->Next->Next
->Save
