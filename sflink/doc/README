sflink menu explanation:

Accountexport - export organizations from Achievo to Sales Force. Must be do before contact export.

Contactexport - export contacts from Achievo to Sales Force.

When we do account/contact export, salesforce_id field in organization/person table set to Sales Force ID.

Clearaccount/Clearcontact  - for convinience set salesforce_id field (organization/person table) to null, 
so we have to do export operation again.

Sf_dupe - export/import operations log. All handled records id and name logs to this table, so we can found,
what data has been export/import with and without errors, the errors reason, and is the record already exists 
in Sales Force. Also GetUpdated gets the date of last update from this table.

Accountimport/Contactimport - import all accounts/contacts (with empty Achievo_Id) from Sales Force to Achievo.
Again Accounts must be import firstly, because contact contains link to account, so it must be already present 
in Achievo before contact importing.

Fix - my service menu, for do some fixing in Sales Force/Achievo db. Will be removed.

Cron will run sflink->_doGetUpdated() method.

EmployeeLink - link SalesForce and Achievo employee using email as link field.

How to use. (from top point of menu to button)
1. Have the same user in SalesForce and in Achievo.
2. Do Employeelink.
3. Do Account export (several times, while all account will be export to SF)
4. Do Contact export (several times, while all contact will be export to SF)
5. Do Account import (several times, while all account will be import back to Achievo)
6. Do Contact import (several times, while all contact will import back to Achievo)

The reason of 'several times' - memory overflow error, I think in node->addDb() code. Calling node->addDb() 2000 
time do memory overflow error (128 Mb in my case)
